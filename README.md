# Overview

This repository contains some little generic or datacite related script.

# Installation

Scripts in `/bin` can be used directly.

Scripts in `/init.d` are meant to be copied to `/etc/init.d` to be used as a init script. All `.default` files should be copied `/etc/default/` with ommitted file extension. They are used to configure the init scripts.
