This repository contains some little generic or datacite related scripts.

Scripts in `/bin/` can be used directly.

Scripts in `/init.d/` are meant to be copied to `/etc/init.d/` to be used as an init script. All `.default` files should be copied to `/etc/default/` with ommitted file extension. They are used to configure the init scripts.
